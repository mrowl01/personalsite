				I'm a full stack dev. I taught myself those skills and I'm constantly learning and improving.
				I'm very comfortable with Javascript and C#. I've made applications with front end and back end using React, Redux, Node and Express.
				I love solving new puzzles and getting over brain blocks while developing it's what made learning this so addicting.
				Developing new ideas that help users make their lives easier or more fun is why I started learning to code.
				I'm learning more about machine learning, security and more.
				I also like making games in my free time with Unity3D and I'm currently exploring VR and AR with Unreal Engine.
